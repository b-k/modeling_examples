This is the branch of the repository used for testing Apophenia (and the code itself).

* The outputs directory includes the results from previous runs of the programs,
which were verified using other stats packages or situational knowledge.

* There is a "tests" target in the makefile, which runs all programs and compares
their output to the known good results. Notice that it specifies bash as the shell,
because we use process substitution, provided by bash/zsh/&c. but not the POSIX-standard
sh.

* Numeric programs sometimes differ across machines. A large difference should be
reported as a bug. Small differences---the difference between .99998 and .99999,
say---can still be important, but there are limited resources for debugging and
improving Apophenia and bigger problems to be confronted.

* It is written to compile using apophenia v0.995 or greater. Right now, that means
checking out the v1 branch from the Apophenia repository on Github.
